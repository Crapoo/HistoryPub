                <Explication>The making of this caramel a bit particular takes a lot of knowledge and a lot of patience. The really warm dough is made from sugar and thrown on a hook which helps stretch it several times until it become clear enough. Once this step is done, it is rolled and cut with scissors before wrapping them in a special paper to prevent them from melting. The carabibis given away during the Simpélourd are more "original" than the ones you can find everywhere because a single pastry still makes them using the original recipe.
