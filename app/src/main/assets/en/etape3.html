    <h1>The collegiate of Soignies</h1>
    <img src="../images/collegiale.JPG" />
    <p>
        This collegiate, classed as major Walloon heritage, was built around 1225, while the construction site started around 1015 and 1024. The collegiate is the true heart of the city, which it dominates from its powerful, two-towered figure. It is an imposing building which is, since it's building, a place of pilgrimage and was the headquarters of a powerful community of canons until the end of the 18th century.
