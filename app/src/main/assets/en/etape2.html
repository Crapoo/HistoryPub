    <p>
        During the Pentecost, takes place two particular festivities : the Saint Vincent Tour and the historical procession. Both honour Saint Vincent Madelgaire, founder of Soignies and Saint Waudru's husband. (A famous festivity is linked to Waudru: the Doudou!)

        The Tour is a "procession" of the shrine of Saint Vincent, carried by members of the Saint-Vincent brotherhood, around the city over more than 11km. Already certified around 1262, it is one of the oldest tradition in Belgium.

        More recently, at the end of the Tour, the historical procession makes a path for the holy relics around the city, creating a sumptuous living pictures honouring the Saint. Several hundred extras, horsemen, two chariots and a mobile carillon precede the shrine. At the end of the procession, the relics rejoin the collegiate and are then brought up the raised chapel by four angels.
