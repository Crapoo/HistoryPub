    <h1>The chapter of Soignies</h1>
    <img src="../images/chapitre.jpe" />
    <p>
        For more than 8 centuries (from 935 to 1793), the city life was ruled by the chapter of Soignies. Depending on the period, between 26 and 31 canons administered the "franchise" et its important territories. They incarnated the spiritual and temporal power. No domain was outside their knowledge. The chapter of Soignies, during the feodal period, was truly the Lord. They nominated the bailiffs, ma√Øeurs and every other city officials. No other power (as high as they could be) ruled on their citizens. They recorded their priviledges in a "liber catenatus" (enchained book, dated from the XIIIrd to the XVth century). Those secular monks didn't make any poverty vow and were then allowed to possess a large patrimony. They weren't required to live in the collegiate itself but had to live there for at least 32weeks a year.
