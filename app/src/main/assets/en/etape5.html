    <p>
        In Soignies, during the Saturday preceding the 3rd Sunday of October is Simpélour feast. The feast originates from the history of a poor cobbler who was regularly cheated on by his wife and was mocked by everyone during the XVIIIth century. Cut to the quick, he decided to assemble the main mocker around a meal. Speechless, they went there and got served a wooden piece of ham. Every year citizens of Soignies celebrate this joke. Simpélourd crosses the city, giving sweets away. He is accompanied by several folkloric groups et the famous Soignies' Giants. The event ends with a final rondeau and fireworks. Simpélour then greet the crowd, assembled in the Green Place, from the balcon of a house where he will soon be replaced by a mannequin which will be burnt down during the next Tuesday.
